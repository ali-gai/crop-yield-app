ðŸŒ¾ Crop Yield Prediction App
This project is a machine learning-powered web application built with Streamlit that predicts crop yield based on key environmental and agricultural factors.

ðŸš€ Features
User-friendly interface for quick predictions

Machine Learning backend powered by a trained Decision Tree Regressor

Data preprocessing pipeline with OneHotEncoder & StandardScaler

Real-time predictions based on:

Year

Average Rainfall (mm/year)

Pesticide usage (tonnes)

Average Temperature (Â°C)

Country/Region

Crop Type

Custom-styled buttons and UI for a polished experience

ðŸ›  Tech Stack
Python (pandas, scikit-learn, numpy, pickle)

Streamlit for frontend

Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization

Pickle for saving trained models

ðŸ“Š Model
Algorithm: Decision Tree Regressor

Preprocessing: ColumnTransformer with OneHotEncoding & StandardScaling

Dataset: Global crop yield data with weather and agricultural metrics
